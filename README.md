# SpringMvcJavaConfigration2

Java-Based Configuration for SpringMVC (Maven,SpringCore,SpringMVC,Eclipse,github concepts used...)>

Becauseof we **implements WebApplicationInitializer** to configure Dispatcher Servlet,
we need to use "onStartup" method & provide requred resources to create Dispatcher-Servlet Like:- BeansConfigrationFile (Also java-based)

Note:- this way of configuration is recumended because the developer will have full conrol over it.

Thanks...
